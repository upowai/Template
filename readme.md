### Template:

Welcome to the uPow Incentive Template repository. This repository contains all the necessary information to build your own incentive node (iNode) in the uPow blockchain. If you are new to the uPow blockchain, please refer to the [uPow Documentation](https://upow.ai/docs#creating) for registering an iNode.

### Example Documentation

An iNode in the uPow blockchain consists of several key components and follows specific protocols to ensure efficient task processing and validation. Below is an overview of how the iNode operates:

1. **iNode Components:**
   - **Pools:** Manage and distribute tasks to miners.
   - **Validators:** Ensure the accuracy and authenticity of processed tasks.
   - **Miners:** Perform the tasks assigned by the pools.

2. **Task Communication Protocol:**
   - Miners communicate with pools to receive tasks via established protocols.
   - After completing the tasks, miners send the results back to the minerpool.

3. **Task Validation Process:**
   - The pool send  tasks processed by miners to validators periodically.
   - These tasks are validated by the validator.

4. **Validation and Scoring:**
   - Validators check the tasks and send the responses back to the pool and iNode.
   - The iNode assigns scores to pools and validators based on information given by validators.
   - Emissions are distributed to pools and validators according to these scores.

5. **Action Based on Validation:**
   - Pools use the responses from validators to determine the authenticity of miners.
   - Appropriate actions are taken based on the validators' feedback to ensure system integrity.

### Writing Your Own iNode (Incentive Node)

The following sections describe the main components of the iNode and their respective functionalities. Detailed documentation is provided in each folder.

1. **Protocol:**
   - **Folder:** `protocol`
   - **Description:** Contains WebSocket connections used for communicating between miners, pools, validators and iNodes. This module handles the establishment and maintenance of communication channels, ensuring secure and reliable data transfer.

2. **Reward Logic:**
   - **Folder:** `reward_logic`
   - **Description:** This section includes the algorithms and logic used for calculating and distributing rewards to miners, pools, and validators. It ensures fair and transparent reward mechanisms based on performance metrics.

3. **Transaction Processing:**
   - **Folder:** `transaction`
   - **Description:** Manages the processing of transactions within the uPow blockchain. This includes the creation, validation, and recording of transactions to maintain an accurate and up-to-date ledger.

4. **Task Management:**
   - **Folder:** `task`
   - **Description:** Contains the logic and mechanisms for creating, assigning, and managing tasks. This module ensures that tasks are efficiently distributed to miners and that results are correctly processed and validated.

5. **Validation Logic:**
   - **Repo:** `validator`
   - **Folder:** `task`
   - **Description:** Includes the algorithms and procedures used for validating tasks. This ensures that all tasks meet the required standards and that only authentic results are accepted and rewarded.

By following this template and utilizing the provided modules, you can successfully build and operate your own incentive node within the uPow blockchain. For more detailed information, please refer to the documentation within each folder.
