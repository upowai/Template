# Miner

This miner is designed to communicate with pools, receive tasks, compute using the logic in the codebase, and return the output to the pool.

## Features

- Connects to a specified mining pool using WebSocket.
- Receives and processes computational tasks.
- Submits computed output back to the pool.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pip` for installing Python packages
- An active internet connection

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the Miner repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone  `url`
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the cloned directory and install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

Miner requires specific command-line arguments to start:

- `--MINER_POOL_IP`: The IP address of the miner pool.
- `--MINER_POOL_PORT`: The port number of the miner pool.
- `--WALLET_ADDRESS`: Your wallet address for receiving mining rewards.

## Usage

To run Miner, use the following command:

```bash
python3 miner.py --MINER_POOL_IP "127.0.0.1" --MINER_POOL_PORT 5501 --WALLET_ADDRESS "your_wallet_address"
```

Replace `"127.0.0.1"`, `5501`, and `"your_wallet_address"` with the appropriate miner pool IP, port, and your wallet address.

## Contributing
